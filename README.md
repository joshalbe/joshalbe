### Hello, my name is Joshua Albe

[Resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/ie6b08n6lr6)

[The Sandman Itch.io](https://reposeproductions.itch.io/sandman)

I am a game programmer specializing in AI, with skills in both Unity and Unreal. I've been interested in video games since I was five and my dad would play them after law school classes. This interest persisted through high school, where it broadened into an interest in computers and programming in general. After graduating from Northshore High School in Slidell, LA, I attended Operation Spark classes in New Orleans. After those, I enrolled in the Academy of Interactive Entertainment where I will be graduating in December with an Associate's Degree.

## Current Projects of Interest:
### Sandman
The major production of my second year at AIE. An adventure game created collaboratively with two artists and two other programmers. First iteration was released on Itch.io, but further development is in planning.
### Monster Game
A monster-collecting RPG game, currently in production.
### Bread Crumbs
The minor production of my first year at AIE, a game of navigating a dark maze and trying to get the highest score you can before the Rougarou catches you.
